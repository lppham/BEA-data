Description of data

  These files contain underlying detailed data from the 1997 benchmark 
  input-output (I-O) accounts published in "Benchmark Input-Output Accounts 
  of the United States, 1997," SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS (December 2002).  
  Copies of this article are available free of charge through the 
  BEA web site, www.bea.doc.gov.  Hard copies of the article can also 
  be purchased for $20.  To purchase BEA products using Visa or 
  Mastercard, please call the BEA Order Desk at 1-800-704-0415.  

  The benchmark I-O methodology, coverage of data, and data definitions 
  are explained in the above SURVEY article. 

  Data files containing the tables are comma delimited ASCII
  files consisting of a row I-O code, a column I-O code, a
  table reference number, and the cell value(s).  Values in the Make Table
  and the Use Table represent millions of dollars at producers' prices.  
  Values in the Direct Requirements Table represent coefficients, as 
  specified in the text file beginning with "F" that is associated with 
  the table. All cells in the tables are included.  No copyrighted data are 
  found in these files.
